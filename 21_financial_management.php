/*
In this structure, the script starts by including the db_connection.php file, which contains the necessary code to establish a connection with the MySQL database.

Next, it checks if the user is logged in as a system manager. You would need to implement the login functionality and session handling to perform this check.

After that, the script processes any form submissions or actions. You can handle various financial management actions here, such as generating financial reports, analyzing sales data, or managing invoices and payments.

Following the form processing, the script retrieves the financial information from the financial_data table in the database using a SQL query.

If there are rows returned from the query, the script displays the financial information in an HTML table, including invoice number, customer name, order date, and total amount.

If no financial data is found, it displays a message indicating that no data is available.

Finally, the script closes the database connection.

Note: You would need to modify the structure based on your specific database schema and requirements. Additionally, make sure to handle error cases, implement appropriate security measures, and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.
